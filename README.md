# Game Programming Final Project
A .zip containing the Godot game engine file as well as a release page containing the executable file for Windows users.
I collaborated with three other individuals on this game and largely managed the project. I drew every single asset (except for the title screen and fonts) and also participated in programming.

## Usage

<sub>Note: To open the project source file, you must have Godot downloaded (https://godotengine.org/download).</sub>

To view the project in the Godot game engine (to look at code, assets, etc):

1. Download and unzip the .zip file of the repository.
2. Launch the project.godot file.

To play the game:

1. Download and unzip the .zip file from the releases page of the repository.
2. Make sure that both the .exe and .pck files are in the same folder, and launch the .exe file!

## How to Play

1. Space to jump.
2. A and D to move left and right.
3. Tab to pick up blocks (when applicable).

<sub>Note: some aspects of the game are finicky due to time constraints, so if you get stuck or something is not working correctly, quick and relaunch!</sub>
