# Game Programming Final Project

This repository contains a 2D platformer game developed in the Godot game engine as a final project for my game programming course.

A playable version for Windows is available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/cameronbaum0124/game_programming_final/releases).

## About the Project

I collaborated with three other individuals to create this game and acted as a **co-project lead**.
- Creating **all in-game art assets** (except for the title screen and fonts)
- Participating in gameplay programming
- Managing task distribution, group meetings, and the development timeline

## How to Play

- Space to jump
- A and D to move left and right
- Tab to pick up blocks (when applicable)

<sub>Note: some aspects of the game are finicky due to time constraints, so if you get stuck or something is not working correctly, quick and relaunch!</sub>
